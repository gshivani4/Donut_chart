# Power BI Donut Chart Visualization

Welcome to my repository showcasing a Power BI visualization project featuring a Donut Chart!

## Overview

This repository contains a Power BI report showcasing the use of a Donut Chart visualization. The Donut Chart is a powerful tool for visualizing proportions and percentages within a dataset, providing valuable insights into data distribution and composition.

## Donut Chart Overview

- **Purpose:** The Donut Chart effectively displays proportions and percentages of categories or data segments within a dataset.
- **Visualization:** Each segment in the Donut Chart represents a category or data segment, with its size proportional to its share of the whole. Color coding helps distinguish between different segments.
- **Insights:** The chart highlights the distribution and composition of data, making it easy to identify dominant categories or trends.
